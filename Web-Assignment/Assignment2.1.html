    <article>
        <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph about some things I enjoy.</p>
        <p>The `<article>` tag is semantic, meaning it represents a self-contained piece of content, like a blog post or a news story.</p>
    </article>

    <div>
        <h2>More Details</h2>
        <p>This `div` is a non-semantic element. It doesn't have a specific meaning, but it's great for grouping content for styling purposes later on with CSS.</p>
    </div>
